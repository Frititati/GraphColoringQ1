  <p align="center">
    In graph theory, graph coloring is a special case of graph labeling; in which particular labels, traditionally called “colors”, are assigned to elements of a graph subject to certain constraints.
    <br /> In its simplest form, it is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices are of the same color. Graph coloring enjoys many practical applications as well as theoretical challenges. Many graph applications are based on vertex coloring and many graph properties are based on graph coloring. Moreover, vertex coloring is the most famous version of coloring since other coloring problems can be transformed into a vertex coloring instance.
